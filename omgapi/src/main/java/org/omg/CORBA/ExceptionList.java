/**
 * An object used in <code>Request</code> operations to
 * describe the exceptions that can be thrown by a method.  It maintains a
 * modifiable list of <code>TypeCode</code>s of the exceptions.
 * <P>
 * The following code fragment demonstrates creating
 * an <code>ExceptionList</code> object:
 * <PRE>
 *    ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null);
 *    org.omg.CORBA.ExceptionList excList = orb.create_exception_list();
 * </PRE>
 * The variable <code>excList</code> represents an <code>ExceptionList</code>
 * object with no <code>TypeCode</code> objects in it.
 * <P>
 * To add items to the list, you first create a <code>TypeCode</code> object
 * for the exception you want to include, using the <code>ORB</code> method
 * <code>create_exception_tc</code>.  Then you use the <code>ExceptionList</code>
 * method <code>add</code> to add it to the list.
 * The class <code>ExceptionList</code> has a method for getting
 * the number of <code>TypeCode</code> objects in the list, and  after
 * items have been added, it is possible to call methods for accessing
 * or deleting an item at a designated index.
 *
