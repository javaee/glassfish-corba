/**

 * Holder files, see <a href="doc-files/generatedfiles.html#holder">
 * "Generated Files: Holder Files"</a>.<P>
 * FixedHolder is a container class for values of IDL type "fixed",
 * which is mapped to the Java class java.math.BigDecimal.
 * It is usually used to store "out" and "inout" IDL method parameters.
 * If an IDL method signature has a fixed as an "out" or "inout" parameter,
 * the programmer must pass an instance of FixedHolder as the corresponding
 * parameter in the method invocation; for "inout" parameters, the programmer
 * must also fill the "in" value to be sent to the server.
 * Before the method invocation returns, the ORB will fill in the contained
 * value corresponding to the "out" value returned from the server.
