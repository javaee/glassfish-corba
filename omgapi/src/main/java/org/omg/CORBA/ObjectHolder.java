/**
 * The Holder for <tt>Object</tt>.  For more information on 
 * Holder files, see <a href="doc-files/generatedfiles.html#holder">
 * "Generated Files: Holder Files"</a>.<P>
 * A Holder class for a CORBA object reference (a value of type
 * <code>org.omg.CORBA.Object</code>).  It is usually
 * used to store "out" and "inout" parameters in IDL methods.
 * If an IDL method signature has a CORBA Object reference as an "out"
 * or "inout" parameter, the programmer must pass an instance of
 * <code>ObjectHolder</code> as the corresponding
 * parameter in the method invocation; for "inout" parameters, the programmer
 * must also fill the "in" value to be sent to the server.
 * Before the method invocation returns, the ORB will fill in the
 * value corresponding to the "out" value returned from the server.
 * <P>
 * If <code>myObjectHolder</code> is an instance of <code>ObjectHolder</code>,
 * the value stored in its <code>value</code> field can be accessed with
 * <code>myObjectHolder.value</code>.
 *
 * @version     1.14, 09/09/97
