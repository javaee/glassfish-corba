 * A Holder class for a <code>ServiceInformation</code> object
 * that is used to store "out" and "inout" parameters in IDL methods.
 * If an IDL method signature has an IDL <code>xxx</code> as an "out"
 * or "inout" parameter, the programmer must pass an instance of
 * <code>ServiceInformationHolder</code> as the corresponding
 * parameter in the method invocation; for "inout" parameters, the programmer
 * must also fill the "in" value to be sent to the server.
 * Before the method invocation returns, the ORB will fill in the
 * value corresponding to the "out" value returned from the server.
 * <P>
 * If <code>myServiceInformationHolder</code> is an instance of <code>ServiceInformationHolder</code>,
 * the value stored in its <code>value</code> field can be accessed with
 * <code>myServiceInformationHolder.value</code>.
