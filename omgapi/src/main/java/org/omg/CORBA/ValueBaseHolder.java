 * A Holder class for a <code>java.io.Serializable</code>

 * If an IDL method signature has an IDL <code>ValueBase</code> as an "out"
 * or "inout" parameter, the programmer must pass an instance of
 * <code>ValueBaseHolder</code> as the corresponding
 * parameter in the method invocation; for "inout" parameters, the programmer
 * must also fill the "in" value to be sent to the server.
 * Before the method invocation returns, the ORB will fill in the
 * value corresponding to the "out" value returned from the server.
 * <P>
 * If <code>myValueBaseHolder</code> is an instance of <code>ValueBaseHolder</code>,
 * the value stored in its <code>value</code> field can be accessed with
 * <code>myValueBaseHolder.value</code>.
