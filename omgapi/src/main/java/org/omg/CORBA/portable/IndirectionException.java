 * The Indirection exception is a Java specific system exception. 
 * It is thrown when the ORB's input stream is called to demarshal 
 * a value that is encoded as an indirection that is in the process 
 * of being demarshaled. This can occur when the ORB input stream 
 * calls the ValueHandler to demarshal an RMI value whose state 
 * contains a recursive reference to itself. Because the top-level 
 * ValueHandler.read_value() call has not yet returned a value, 
 * the ORB input stream's indirection table does not contain an entry 
 * for an object with the stream offset specified by the indirection 
 * tag. The stream offset is returned in the exception's offset field.
