Provides a portability layer, that is, a set of ORB APIs
that makes it possible for code generated
by one vendor to run on another vendor's ORB. 
Stubs and other code, generated either from IDL or 
interfaces written in the Java programming language, 
can call into these ORB APIs.

<h1>CORBA Features Throwing NO_IMPLEMENT() Exceptions</h1>
<hr>
Some methods throw NO_IMPLEMENT() exceptions by default, but ORB vendors
can override them to provide real implementations.  The ORB included in
Sun's release of the Java[tm] Platform, Standard Edition 6, includes 
implementations for the following methods.
