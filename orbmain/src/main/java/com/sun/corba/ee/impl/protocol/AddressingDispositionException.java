 * 
 * GIOP 1.2 allows three dispositions : KeyAddr (ObjectKey), ProfileAddr (ior 
 * profile), IORAddressingInfo (IOR). If the ORB does not support the
 * disposition contained in the GIOP Request / LocateRequest 1.2 message, 
 * then it sends a Reply / LocateReply indicating the correct disposition, 
 * which the client ORB shall use to transparently retry the request  
 * with the correct disposition.
