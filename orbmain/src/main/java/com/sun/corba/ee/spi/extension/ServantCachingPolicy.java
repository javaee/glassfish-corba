/** Policy used to implement servant caching optimization in the POA.
* Creating a POA with an instance pol of this policy where 
* pol.getType() &gt; NO_SERVANT_CACHING will cause the servant to be
* looked up in the POA and cached in the LocalClientRequestDispatcher when
* the ClientRequestDispatcher is colocated with the implementation of the
* objref.  This greatly speeds up invocations at the cost of violating the
* POA semantics.  In particular, every request to a particular objref
* must be handled by the same servant.  Note that this is typically the
* case for EJB implementations.
* <p>
* If servant caching is used, there are two different additional 
* features of the POA that are expensive:
* <ol>
* <li>POA current semantics
* <li>Proper handling of POA destroy.
* <ol>
* POA current semantics requires maintaining a ThreadLocal stack of
* invocation information that is always available for POACurrent operations.
* Maintaining this stack is expensive on the timescale of optimized co-located
* calls, so the option is provided to turn it off.  Similarly, causing 
* POA.destroy() calls to wait for all active calls in the POA to complete
* requires careful tracking of the entry and exit of invocations in the POA.
* Again, tracking this is somewhat expensive.
