// - BEFORE_RESPONSE means that the retry is caused by 
//   something that happened BEFORE the message was sent: either 
//   an exception from the SocketFactory, or one from the 
//   Client side send_request interceptor point.
// - AFTER_RESPONSE means that the retry is a result either of the
//   request sent to the server (from the response), or from the
//   Client side receive_xxx interceptor point.
