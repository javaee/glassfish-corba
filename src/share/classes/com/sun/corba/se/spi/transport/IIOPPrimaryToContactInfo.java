 * This interface is the "sticky manager" for IIOP failover.  The default

 *
 * It uses the IIOP primary host/port (with a SocketInfo.IIOP_CLEAR_TEXT type)
 * as a key to map to the last ContactInfo that resulted in successful'
 * communication.
 *
 * It mainly prevents "fallback" - if a previously failed replica comes
 * back up we do NOT want to switch back to using it - particularly in the
 * case of statefull session beans.
 *
 * Note: This assumes static lists of replicas (e.g., AS 8.1 EE).
 * This does NOT work well with LOCATION_FORWARD.
