The CORBA_2_3 package defines additions to existing CORBA interfaces
in the Java[tm] Standard Edition 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; These changes occurred in recent
revisions to the CORBA API defined by the OMG.&nbsp; The new methods were
added to&nbsp; interfaces derived from the corresponding interfaces in
the CORBA package.&nbsp; This provides backward compatibility and avoids
breaking the JCK tests.
