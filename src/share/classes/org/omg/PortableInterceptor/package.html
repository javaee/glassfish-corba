Provides a mechanism to register ORB hooks through which ORB services
can intercept the normal flow of execution of the ORB.

<h2>Interceptor Types</h2>
There are currently three types of interceptors that can be registered:
<ul>
  <li>{@link org.omg.PortableInterceptor.IORInterceptor IORInterceptor} - 
      Used to establish tagged components in the profiles within an IOR.</li>
  <li>{@link org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ClientRequestInterceptor 
ClientRequestInterceptor} - 
      Intercepts the flow of a request/reply sequence through the ORB on 
      the <i>client</i> side.</li>
  <li>{@link org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ServerRequestInterceptor 
ServerRequestInterceptor} - 
      Intercepts the flow of a request/reply sequence through the ORB on 
      the <i>server</i> side.</li>
</ul>
See the javadocs for class <code>
{@link org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializer ORBInitializer}</code> 
for how to go about registering interceptors.

<h2>Known limitations / unimplemented methods in package 
<code>org.omg.PortableInterceptor</code></h2>

<code>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>RequestInfo</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>sync_scope()</b>: Always returns SYNC_WITH_TRANSPORT</li>
      <li><b>arguments()</b>: Only supported for DII/DSI calls</li>
      <li><b>exceptions()</b>: Only supported for DII calls on client side.  
          Not supported on server-side.</li>
      <li><b>contexts()</b>: Only supported for DII calls on client side.
          Not supported on server-side since our ORB does not send contexts.
          </li>
      <li><b>operation_context()</b>: Only supported for DII calls 
          on client side.  Not supported on server-side since ORB 
          does not send contexts.</li>

  <li>
    <b>ClientRequestInfo</b>
    <ul>
