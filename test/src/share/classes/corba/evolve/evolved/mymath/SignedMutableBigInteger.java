/**
 * A class used to represent multiprecision integers that makes efficient
 * use of allocated space by allowing a number to occupy only part of
 * an array so that the arrays do not have to be reallocated as often.
 * When performing an operation with many iterations the array used to
 * hold a number is only increased when necessary and does not have to
 * be the same size as the number it represents. A mutable number allows
 * calculations to occur on the same number without having to create
 * a new number for every step of the calculation as occurs with
 * BigIntegers.
 *
 * Note that SignedMutableBigIntegers only support signed addition and
 * subtraction. All other operations occur as with MutableBigIntegers.
