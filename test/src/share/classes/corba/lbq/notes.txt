Combined FOLB quiesce test with simulated HW loadbalancer

Idea:

Start up the following controllers:

ORBD
LB
Server1
Server2
Server3
Client
Orchestrator

The Client and Server controllers are very simple standard
dynamic RMI-IIOP programs, using persistent POAs, that
simply send requests and handle them, except that
the servers each implement an object that controls whether
they are rejecting requests or not.  The client implements
an interface that tells it how many requests to send.

Client has a combined plugin that includes:
(from LB) NoConnectionCacheImpl
(from retryplugin) RetryClientRequestInterceptor

Server has a combined plugin that includes:
(from LN) VirtualAddressAgentImpl
(from retryplugin) RetryServerRequestInterceptor

LB is basically the lb test LB class, but it also has an
ORB and implements a control object.

ORBD is only used for naming, as usual.

The Orchestrator controls the test.  It uses naming to
find everything else, then runs the test.

Interfaces:

// One of these is implemented in LB.  LB is started only with listener:
// all ports are added.
interface LBControl extends Remote {
    // After receiving numConnections, add port to the pool.
    // Each call to add or remove is added to a queue of commands.
    void add( int numConnections, int port ) throws RemoteException ;

    // After receiving numConnections, remove port from the pool.
    // Each call to add or remove is added to a queue of commands.
    void remove( int numConnections, int port ) throws RemoteException ;
}

// One of these is implemented by each server.
interface ServerControl extends Remote {
    // Query the server to discover its port for use in LB
    int getPort() throws RemoteException ;

    // Register the reporter with this server.  It is invoked
    // every time the server handles a request.
    void registerReportCallback( ServerReporter reporter ) throws RemoteException ;

    // Causes the server to start rejecting requests after numRequests have 
    // been handled.
    // setRejecting and clearRejecting can be queued.
    void setRejecting( int numRequests ) throws RemoteException ;

    // Causes the server to stop rejecting requests after numRequests
    // have been rejected.
    // setRejecting and clearRejecting can be queued.
    void clearRejecting(int numRequests ) throws RemoteException ;
}

// Implemented in Client
interface ClientControl extends Remote {
    void startSendingRequests( int numRequests ) throws RemoteException ;
}

// One of these is implemented by Orchestrator for each server instance and
// registered with the server.
interface ServerReporter extends Remote {
    void requestReceived( int requestNumber ) throws RemoteException ;
}

Namespace:
root
    control (namespace)
	LBControl
	Client
	servers (namespace)
	    // contains one objref for ServerControl for each server

Note that all of these control objects are implemented with a separate
ORB that does not use any of the various plugins that are being tested
here.  I'll probably create a simple utility class for setting this up.

Orchestrator operation:

(Basic LB test)
1. Orch queries name server to get all ServerControl objects 
2. Orch creates a ServerReporter for each ServerControl and 
   registers it
3. Add each server to LBControl
4. Tell Client to send 3*N requests
5. Each server sends a message to orch when it handles a request
6. Check that N messages were received from each server

(Quiesce test)
7. Orch tells Server2 to reject requests after handling N requests
8. Orch tells Server2 to handle requests after rejecting M requests
9. Orch tells LB to remove Server2 after 3*N+2*M connections
10. Orch tells LB to add Server2 after 3*N+2*M+2*P connections
11. Orch tells client to send 3*N+2*M+2*P+3*Q requests
(Operation should be as follows:
first 3*N requests: normal LB over 3 servers
next 2*M requests: only server1 and server3 handle requests; server2
    continuously rejects requests.  I think this will result in the
    following behavior:
	client invokes, LB to S1: handled
	client invokes, LB to S2: forwarded back to self, so:
	    client invokes, LB to S3: handled
	client invokes, LB to S1: handled
    since each forwarded request should result in a new connection
next 2*P requests: LB only sends requests to server1 and server3
next 2*Q requests: LB to all servers again

12. Orch should see: 
    Server1 N+M+P+Q requests
    Server2 N+Q requests
    Server3 N+M+P+Q requests

Do we need other tests?

How do we manage control plane objects?

Need a getControlPlaneORB() method that
    guarantees no interference in creating transient objects.
    
Info to create:
    orb
    servant
    remote interface type
    namespace name
