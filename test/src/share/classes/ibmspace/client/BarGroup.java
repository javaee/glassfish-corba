// A container for LabeledBarControls.  This was done very quick
// and dirty, but would be a useful class if done more generally
// ... maybe later.  Anyway, this class holds a set of bars and
// arranges them vertically or horizontally, depending on the
// orientations of the bars (which need to all be the same, this
// error is not handled so be careful!).  It then also handles
// some group activity semantics kinda' like a radio group would
// have.  This allows me to resize other bars in the group when
// on is resized by the user.
