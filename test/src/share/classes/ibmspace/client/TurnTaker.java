// This class puts turn taking into a thread so that the UI remains
// responsive.  You take a turn by pressing the "Take Turn" button.
// The button then becomes "Waiting for other players" and may stay
// that way for a while, until all other players have pushed their
// buttons.  During this time, your turn call is blocked in the server.
// But because I didn't like being stuck during this time, I made it
// possible to do anything but take another turn while waiting for
// other players.  So you can start working on your other turn while
// waiting for other players to finish this turn.  In reality, though,
// some of the things you do will affect the current turn that is blocked
// and waiting for other players.  This obviously needs more work, but
// it's a start!
