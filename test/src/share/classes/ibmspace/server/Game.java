// The game is the game model, that is the game logic and state.  It is
// exercised by multiple remote clients acting through game view servers.
// So clients never access the game object directly.  The game uses many
// other objects that represents portions of the game, e.g. fleet, battle,
// galaxy, planet and population.  In addition to illustrating use of
// rmi-iiop, I also wrote this sample to model good OO design.  But the
// sample was cranked out in a relatively short time so please excuse any
// obvious short-cuts that were taken.
