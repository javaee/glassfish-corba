// This server models a given players view of the game.  Each
// player gets his/her own game view server from the space
// conquest server at the game's onset and then uses it to take
// all game actions and get all game status/data from then on.
// All game servers rely on the same underlying game and other
// game modeling objects the represent the same game for all
// players.  So essentially the game view server implements a
// a game security, so to speak, that only allows each player
// to see what is allowed to be seen.  Also, rather that returning
// game objects which would destroy this security, the game view
// server always returns game information by creating summary objects
// that capture only what players are allowed to see of the real
// game objects from which they are created.  All summary objects are
// part of the ibmspace.common package, e.g. BudgetSummary.

// Note:  This example is intended mainly to illustrate a non-trivial
// Java application using rmi-iiop for network communication.  It already
// uses rmi-iiop in many typical patterns of use and will be a test
// bed for more of these over time.  The game simulation, while not bad,
// has not been a primary focus of this example and can certainly be
// improved.
