// This server is bound with the name server and is the first stop
// for all clients joining the game.  Each client uses this server
// to (1) get the basic map of the galaxy sans specific details they
// learn about planets later during play, and (2) get a player-
// specific game view server to represent a player-specific view of
// the game.  This models the fact that each player only sees the
// parts of the galaxy they experience through play.  So, for example,
// a player only sees the current temperature, etc, of a planer when
// he/she has ships stationed there or has a colony there.
