Types:

( type_seq ) 

Primitives (Java primitives use java type codes)

boolean		Z
    read_boolean

byte		B
    read_octet

char		C
    read_wchar

short		S   
    read_short	

int		I
    read_long 

long		J
    read_longlong

float		F
    read_float

double		D
    read_double

String		Q
    read_Value(String.class)

Objref		R
    read ior only:
    IORFactories.makeIOR( InputStream )

Typecode	T
    read_TypeCode

Any		A   
    look at Util.readAny
	just do read_any result is either objref or value

(ignore Principal, fixed, and context)
Abstract Interface
    first read boolean, then either objref or value: handle this in the type string

array of type	@type
    read length
    read type for length

object		{ type* }
    read header (save info)
    read chunk header if necessary
    NOTE: we do not attempt to determine the type in order to
    read as the ORB must.  Instead we just read according to
    the description.

Indirection
    we want to correlate with previously read data
    Maintain cache as usual
    Store each possibly referenced item in the cache using get_offset to
    obtain the correct offset from the stream (see CorbaTransportManager.getMessageData( byte[][] ))
    do NOT use CDR stream cache, as we do not want to depend on that much of the implementation.
    Add get_offset to CDRInputStream and make it public (or this won't work)

Is this sufficient to drive a simple CLI message parser?

BCI@Q{BC{QQ}}

and similar strings

Note: display complex types using the ObjectUtility toString methods

Tool design

Input: 
    - A file containing buffers in ORBUtility.getBuffer format that also
      meet the requirements of CorbaTransportManager.getMessageData 
      (that is, request/reply + fragments if more than one packet)

    - a type description

Output:
    - results of parsing the message(s)

Operation:
    - need to determine how message demarcation works
    - extend getBuffer to return byte[][]
    - get MessageData for byte[][] data
    - display headers
    - parse data according to type, displaying results

Value type
    tag is 0x7FFFFF00
    bit 0: 1 iff codebase URL is present
    bits 1 and 2:
	0: no type info
	2: single repoid
	6: list of repoid
    bit 3: 1 if chunked encoding

value	    -> value_tag [ codebase_URL ] [ type_info ] state
	    |  value_ref

value_ref   -> indirection_tag indirection
	    | null_tag

value_tag   -> {long in range 0x7FFFFF00 to 0x7FFFFFFF}

type_info   -> rep_ids
	    | repository_id

state	    -> octects
	    | value_data* [ end_tag ]

value_data  -> value_chunk 
	    | value

rep_ids	    -> long repository_id+
	    | indirection_tag indirection

repository_id -> string
	    | indirection_tag indirection

value_chunk	-> chunk_size_tag octets

null_tag	-> (long)0

indirection_tag	-> (long)0xFFFFFFFF

codebase_URL	-> string
		| indirection_tag indirection

chunk_size_tag  -> {long in range 1 to 0x7FFFFFEFF}

end_tag		-> {long in range 1-2^31 to -1}

indirection	-> {long in range 1-2^31 to -1}

80000001	first end chunk
...
FFFFFFFF	last end chunk/indirection
00000000	null
00000001	first chunk length
...
7FFFFEFF	last chunk length
7FFFFF00	first value header
...
7FFFFFFF	last value header

Is there an ambiguity here for an end tag of -1?
This could either be an end tag, or it could be the start
of an indirection for a value type.  But note that, if
it is an end tag, it is the end of the outermost value
type.

Representations

All values are represented by a common interface:

interface Datum {
    void display( PrintStream ps, int startIndent, int indentIncrement ) ;

    Object value() ;

    // Type of this datum as given in the input description
    String type() ;
}

interface ValueDatum extends Datum {
    String codebaseURL() ;

    String[] repositoryIds() ;

    boolean isChunked() ;

    List<Datum> contents() ;
}

interface ArrayDatum extends Datum {
    Datum[] data() ;
}

Basic implementation is interpreter with stack of type strings.
Most actions are obvious from the table above, but values are
complicated:

"{":	start of new value type
    - handle indіrection if present in input stream
    - enter new ValueDatum into table for indirections
    - read value header, code base URL, and repo IDs
    - read chunk length if present
    - push ValueDatum onto interpreter stack

"}":	end of value type
    - if chunked, skip to end of chunk
    - if chunked, read end tag
    - pop value datum from stack and put into container

This points out that we need an outermost container, which is pushed
onto the interpreter stack first.  When the stack is empty, we
are/must be done.

Possible extension:
    - add dictionary to args that maps repo ID to parser types
    - we could support multiple dictionaries to include JDK built ins and
      user extensions
