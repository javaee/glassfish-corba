    <H2>Architecture</H2> 
    <P>The following documents give a high-level discussion of some aspects of
    the ORB architecture:</P>
    <UL> 
        <LI>
        <A HREF="http://haroldcarr.net/computerScience/pept/indexPept.html">PEPt architecture</A>.
        This is the request handling architecture for the ORB.</LI> 
        <LI><A HREF="design/SAF/introduction.pdf">Server Activation Framework document.</A>This discusses
        the current ORBD design and some ideas for a portable implementation using the 
        Object Reference Template that would replace the current ORBD.  This document is
        only available in PDF, due to HTML conversion problems in FrameMaker 7.</LI>
        <LI><A HREF="design/orbdArchitecture.html">ORBD Architecture</A>.  This is an early document on some aspects of fault tolerance and load
        balancing</LI> 
        <LI>Failover and load balancing (IIOP FOLB) is an important ORB feature that is part of GlassFish.  A number
        of documents are available describing FOLB:
            <UL>
            <LI>A paper <A HREF="design/FOLB/FODynamicCluster.pdf">(pdf)</A> Harold and I wrote describing the design of the IIOP FOLB mechanisms.</LI>
            <LI>The functional specification <A HREF="design/FOLB/AS9.0-RMI-IIOP-FOLB-FS.pdf">(pdf)</A>  
            <A HREF="design/FOLB/AS9.0-RMI-IIOP-FOLB-FS.odt">(odt)</A> 
            Harold wrote for FOLB in SJSAS 9.1 EE.  Most of the
            material is still relevant to GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.1</LI>
            <LI>The <A HREF="design/FOLB/IIOPFOLBOnePager.html">one pager</A> for IIOP FOLB as it will be delivered in GlassFish Server
            Open Source Edition 3.1</LI>
        </LI>
    </UL> 
    <P>Here are some more detailed descriptions of parts of the ORB design:
    </P> 
    <UL> 
        <LI>Presentation 
        <UL> 
            <LI>Dynamic RMI-IIOP 
            <UL> 
                <LI><A
                HREF="design/dynamic_rmi_iiop_optimization.html">Optimization notes</A>. These
                changes are now in place.</LI> 
                <LI><A HREF="design/dynamic_rmi_iiop.htm">Design</A></LI> 
            </UL></LI> 
        </UL></LI> 
        <LI>Encoding. 
        This area is not well documented at present.  Everett Anderson (no longer involved
        with this project) wrote some useful documentation back in 2002:
        <UL>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres1/serial1pres.html">Serialization 1:</A> Overview</LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres2/serial2pres.html">Serialization 2:</A> Valuetype Code</LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres3/serial3pres.html">Serialization 3:</A> RMI-IIOP Stream Format 2 Overview</LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres4/serial4pres.html">Serialization 4:</A> Serializable Refresh</LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres5/serial5pres.html">Serialization 5:</A> Stream Format 2</LI>
            <LI><A HREF="design/everett/serial_pres/pres6/serial6pres.html">Serialization 6:</A> Remaining Items</LI>
        </UL>
        Some parts of these presentations are a bit outdated, but the technical content is still
        correct and useful.
        </LI> 
        <LI>Protocol 
        <P>There's not a lot written for this layer either.  There is a lot of code in the ORB 
        that represents the GIOP protocol messages, but that is pretty simple.  The transport-protocol
        dispatch does need to be documented somewhere.<P>
        <UL> 
            <LI><A HREF="design/testing_giop.html">GIOP Testing</A></LI> 
            <LI><A HREF="design/GIOP_blunders.html">GIOP Blunders</A> (aka things
            I wish the GIOP specification did differently)</LI> 
        </UL></LI> 
        <LI>Transport</LI> 
        <LI>Utility (or things that do not fit elsewhere) 
        <UL> 
            <LI><A HREF="design/ThreadPool.html">Thread Pool</A></LI> 
            <LI><A HREF="design/monitoring.html">Monitoring Extensions</A></LI> 
            <LI><A HREF="design/copyobject.htm">Copyobject</A></LI> 
        </UL></LI> 
    </UL> 
    <P>The ORB also has an extensive internal SPI that is used by the GlassFIsh project.
    Javadocs for the ORB SPI are available 
    <A HREF="https://glassfish-corba.dev.java.net/javadoc/index.html">here</A>.</BODY>
