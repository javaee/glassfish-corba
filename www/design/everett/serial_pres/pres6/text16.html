<h1>JDK 1.3.0</h1>
<ul><li><h2>Currently listed as EOL'd on <a href="http://java.sun.com/">java.sun.com</a></h2></li>
<li><h2>We are really only able to support compatibility with at least JDK 1.3.1_01 and later.  For all RMI-IIOP exceptions to work, make that 1.3.1_05.</h2></li>
<li><h2>1.3.0 always wrote the calledDefaultWriteObject RMI-IIOP custom marshaling indicator as false, so may not interact well with the new stream states that actually consider this.  (It was changed to always be true in 1.3.1, the more common case.)</h2></li>
