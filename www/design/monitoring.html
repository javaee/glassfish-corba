         <H2>ORB Monitoring Extensions for AS 8.2</H2> 
         <P>It has become apparent that some changes are needed in the ORB
                monitoring framework for AS 8.2. The current monitoring code in the ORB is
                overly long and difficult to construct. We also need to consider upcoming
                requirements in AS 8.2 in areas such as dynamic configuration changes and
                self-tuning. I would like to build a dynamic MBean directly in the ORB so that
                we can more readily experiment with different maangement tools, and also to
                fully validate the ORB monitoring framework design. </P> 
         <P>Note: this is basically obsolete, given the new JMX utilities</P>
         <H3>Simplifying the Usage of ORB Monitoring</H3> 
         <P>Currently the ORB monitoring code is rather long. For example, here is

                  <P>(BIG assumption): Use a Dynamic MBean constructed by introspection
                         on the MonitoredXXX objects reachable from the Root MonitoredObject in the ORB.
                         This eliminates the need for MonitoringConstants, and consequently simplifies

                         Stats layer (ugh). We could simply keep the necessary constants for the AS in

         <H4>MonitoredObjects for JavaBeans</H4> 
         <P>A further extension to this is possible. Consider the case of ORBData.
                ORBData has a lot of methods that look like: </P> 
         <PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">     (some data type) getXXXX() ;</PRE> 
         <P> This is the standard pattern for a JavaBean accessor method for a
                property named "XXXX". In addition, we have methods like: </P> 
         <PRE>    boolean isJavaSerializationEnabled() ;

    boolean showInfoMessages() ;</PRE> 
         <P> A method name that returns a boolean and starts with "is" is a JavaBean
                accessor method. Unfortunately ORBData has a lot of boolean methods that do not
                start with "is", so we cannot directly use the JavaBean Introspector. However,
                the job is simple enough that that is not necessary. Alternatively we could
                pull all of the information out of the ParserTable class. In any case, the idea
                is to create a MonitoredObject for ORBData that reflects all of the
                configuration data for the ORB. We will discuss why this is useful a bit later.
                </P> 
         <H3>Some ORB Monitoring Problems</H3> 
         <P>Currently there are two different ways of getting information the root
                monitored object: either we call </P> 
         <PRE>MonitoringFactories.getMonitoringManagerFactory().createMonitoringManager(
  (root name), description ).getRootMonitoredObject()</PRE> 
         <P> or we call </P> 
         <PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">orb.getMonitoringManager().getRootMonitoredObject()</PRE> 
         <P> Having two different ways of getting information is a frequent source
                of problems. These two mechanisms agree when the (root name) is the same as the
                corresponding value in the ORB, but that is currently not the case, due to the
                change I made to make sure that the monitoring code does not get overwritten by
                multiple ORBs. Hosever, the createMonitoringManager call will create a new
                MonitoringManager and root MonitoredObject whenever it is called. Currently I
                see two difference MonitoringManager objects in the app server: one with root
                named "orb", and one with root named "orb_S1AS-ORB_1", which comes from the app
                server's standard ORB id and the change I made in ORB b42 to fix bug 4919770.
                </P> 
         <P>Another problem occurs here because the ThreadPool always uses the first
                form to get to the root MonitoredObject, which is indepedent of the ORB. This
                means that all ThreadPools, no matter how they are created or where they are
                used, will be associated with the root MonitoredObject that corresponds to the
                first ORB created with ORB id "". This means that the threadpool monitoring
                will work regardless of the ORB id in the current app server. I still cannot
                reproduce Sheetal's bug, but it seems unlikely to be a significant problem.
                </P> 
         <P>On the other hand, the connection monitoring goes straight to the ORB to
                get the root monitored object. Some suggestions for 8.2: </P> 
         <OL> 
                <LI> 
                  <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There should be only one possible root
                         MonitoredObject, and a single MonitoringManager. The ORB should create its
                         monitoring root under this top-level (probably unnamed) root object, using the
                         current naming convention. </P> </LI>

                         ORB. Instead, we should register the threadpool under its own root, independent

         <P>Given the possibility of changing MonitoredAttribute values, it becomes
                necessary to consider how the ORB can find out about changes. For this, we need
                to extend the ORB monitoring framework with events and event listeners. </P>

                <LI> 
                  <P>The attribute examines the registered listeners and invokes the
                         attributeChanged method on each listener, giving the listener the

         </OL> 
         <P>The other case we need to consider is creating and destroying
                MonitoredObjects. Here we want to receive either an ObjectCreated or an
                ObjectDestroyed notification on the parent MonitoredObject of the
                MonitoredObject that was created or removed. Here the notification just needs
                the parent and child MonitoredObjects. </P> 
         <P>A listener needs to implement the following interfaces as needed:</P> 
         <PRE>interface AttributeListener {
    void attributeChanged( MonitoredObject object, MonitoredAttribute attribute, Object oldValue,

}

interface ObjectListener {
    void objectCreated( MonitoredObject parent, MonitoredObject child ) ;
    void objectRemoved( MonitoredObject parent, MonitoredObject child ) ;
} ;
</PRE> 
         <P>MonitoredObject needs new methods to handle the registration of
                listeners. I think it may also be useful to have a scope associated with the
                registration, so that a listener can be registered either for events from one
                MonitoredObject, from the immediate descendants of a MonitoredObject, or from
                all descendants of a MonitoredObject. Since we are still using J2SE 1.4, we
                will map these scope values to integer constants. Then we need to add the
                following methods to MonitoredObject:</P> 
         <PRE>interface MonitoredObject {
    ...
    void registerAttributeListener( AttributeListener listener, int scope ) ;

    AttributeListener[]  attributeListeners() ;

    void removeAttributeListener( AttributeListener listener ) ;

    void registerObjectListener( ObjectListener listener, int scope ) ;

    ObjectListener[] objectListeners() ;

    void removeObjectListener( ObjectListener listener ) ;
}

</PRE> 
         <H3>An Architecture for Dynamic Configuration</H3> 
         <P>The basic idea here is simple: provide attribute change notification
                events and configurations agends that listen for these events. But how exactly
                does this work?</P> 
         <P>First, I think we do not need the complex model that JavaBeans use,
                where some events can be vetoed. We still need to decide what the notification
                model should be, what events we support, and how those events get translated
                into Mbean notifications.</P> 
         <H3>ORB dynamic MBean Support</H3> 
         <P>The ORB will probably need to be configurable in where it obtains an
                MBean server. On J2SE, the ORB should use
                java.lang.management.ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer. What to do in
                J2EE is still TBD. </P> 
         <P>What we need to define here is how to map the ORB
                MonitoredObject/MonitoredAttribute framework into MBeans using the JMX
                framework. There are some significant differences in approaches taken in the
                two framworks. The JMX approach is more complex, with more features including
                such items as relations. The ORB Monitoring Framework only supports a single
                hierarchy, which is built in to the definition of the MonitoredObject. The
                genesis of the ORB framework is for monitoring (mostly) performance-related
                attributes of the system, while JMX is intended to be a fully general
                management and monitoring framework.</P> 
         <P>Part of the intent here is to grow the ORB framework to be more general,
                so that it can also support ORB management. Primarily this comes about through
                the addition of notifications. So far I have seen little need to add actions,
                but that is also easily possible.</P>
         <P>There are several problems to solve here:</P>
         <OL>
                <LI>For each MonitoredObject, there is a dynamic MBean whose attributes
                  correspond to the MonitoredAttributes of the Monitored Object.</LI>
                <LI>The name of the MBean is derived from the nesting of the
                  MonitoredObjects starting at the root.</LI>
                <LI>There is an object in the MBean pacakge that listens for
                  MonitoredObject events (registered against the root, scoped for all
                  descendants). This handles events as follows:
                  <OL>
                         <LI>For an attributedChanged event, the attribute on the
                                corresponding MBean is updated. </LI>
                         <LI>For an objectCreated event, an MBean corresponding to the
                                MonitoredObject is created and registered with the MBean server.</LI>
                         <LI>For an objectDestroyed evend, the MBean corresponding to the
                                destroyed MonitoredObject is de-registered from the MBean server.</LI>
                  </OL></LI>

         <H3>Dynamic Tracing in Java Applications</H3> 
         <P>Solaris 10 has recently introduced the dtrace facility, which provides
                extremely useful tools for dignosing and tuning the Solaris OS and C/C++
                applications. What about Java? Here I am not just interested in things like the
                Java stack. Instead, I want to consider extremely large and complex apps like
                the app server, which has many interacting modules, each of which has its own
                unique requirements for monitoring. As monitoring is a big push for AS 8.2 and
                9, it seems that we should seriously consider what we need to do here. </P> 
         <P>In fact, there is a project to do exactly this: it's called<A
                HREF="jtrace_to_svc2.pdf"> jtrace</A>, which is work being done in Janet
                Koenig's group with Sanjay Radia and A. Sundar. More information is available
                in <A HREF="http://jplan.sfbay/feature/264">jplan</A>, and it is currently
                scheduled for Dolphin (J2SE 7). Unfortunately this work is a very long way (3+
                years for J2SE, probably &gt;4 for J2EE) out.</P>
         <P>I wonder if we could do something sooner? There are several
                possibilities:</P>
         <OL>
                <LI>Add instrumentation at the ORB SPI level. This is a very specific
                  case, and somewhat labor-intensive to add. The big question still remains about
                  what to do for the data collection language: DTrace's D is quite nice and
                  fairly large.</LI>
                <LI>Similar to 1, but add the instrumentation at the Container level (in
                  the component-based development sense; see <A
                  HREF="component_notes.html">components</A> for a draft of these ideas).</LI>
                <LI>Combine several ideas: java.lang.Instrument in J2SE 5.0, byte-code
                  instrumentation using ASM or BCEL, remote communications (perhaps using
                  CORBA?), and the current Dtrace to create more-or-less what is needed. The key
                  piece here is implementing a custom provider for DTrace (for which there is no
                  information at present).</LI>
                <LI>It might be nice to be able to use MBeans as well with a tracing tool
                  of some sort.</LI>
