<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">Introduction</H1>
<P CLASS="western">This document describes infrastructure for
supporting scalability and availability (i.e., load balancing,  fault
tolerance and online-upgrades) for IIOP requests in S1AS8/EE. The
general infrastructure is called ORBD (for historical reasons).
However, as we describe the architecture it should become clear that
ORBD is the component in the infrastructure that supports failover
and other components support load-balancing.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">To understand why an ORBD is useful, suppose an
application is initially deployed on a single server instance, and
then later migrated to a different pair of server instances for
failover.  If the original IOR referred directly to the single server
instance it is impossible to make the change transparently.  It is
impossible to find all occurrences of the original IOR for arbitrary
CORBA clients.  It is also impossible for an application running on
the app server that uses IOR stringification. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<H2 CLASS="western">General ORBD Operation</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The primary function of ORBD is to redirect
incoming requests to an appropriate server instance in a cluster.
ORBD supports this function by maintaining a snapshot (not
necessarily perfect) of the state of the nodes and server instances
in a cluster. State maintenance in a cluster where different
components are starting and stopping is a significant part of the
ORBD architecture and will be discussed in detail in later sections.</P>
<P CLASS="western">In order to understand how ORBD handles an
incoming request, we first need to look at how IORs are created. All
IORs are created from a POA instance using the
create_reference_from_id method, which is supplied type id and object
id arguments. The object id is a unique identifier for the IOR in the
context of this particular POA. In the app server, this is typically
derived from the primary database key for the EJB state.</P>
<P CLASS="western">create_reference_from_id delegates to the
make_object method on the ORT instance associated with the POA. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The POA is created by the container whenever an
EJB type is deployed in the container. Each POA instance gets part of
its template created from the ORB that created the POA. An ORBD
<SPAN LANG="en-US">IORInterceptor</SPAN> is also installed in the
ORB. All of this operates as follows to create the POA:</P>

        an <SPAN LANG="en-US">IORTemplate</SPAN>, and adds profile templates
        for each protocol registered with the ORB to the IORTemplate. The
        IORTemplate is returned.</P>
        <LI><P CLASS="western">The POA creates its <SPAN LANG="en-US">ObjectReferenceTemplate</SPAN>

<P CLASS="western">The S1AS7 EJB to POA mapping assumes that session

<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Note: by definition, a transient POA can never be
re-started and produce the same object references.  It is possible
that we do not want to use transient POAs for stateless session beans
in the presence of replicas, because the lifetime of the replica can
be less than the lifetime of the object reference, and the transient
POA is tied to the lifetime of the replica.  ORBD allows us to get
around this problem too, but all ORBD replicas need to be updated
with newly created transient POA templates, which is potentially
expensive if there are a lot a replicas.</P>

<P CLASS="western">Another consideration is ease-of-implementation:
ORBD needs a lot of the infrastructure present in the app server
process (e.g., DAS cache, server monitoring, startup).  Putting the
ORBD in an app server instance avoids the need to manage separate
ORBD processes.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">It is not necessary to run ORBD in every app
server instance. Any instance may run ORBD if configured to do so.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Another consideration is evolution. How much
change is allowed after the app server cluster is installed.  ORBD
allows both the number and location of EJB replicas to change
dynamically.  The location of ORBD repliaces can change dynamically
by using DNS names (rather than IP addresses) in ORBD IIOP profiles
that are resolved via DNS.  The only thing that cannot easily change
dynamically is the number of ORBD instances which is wired into every
IOR that an app server creates. That limitation can be removed by
using IP multicast to broadcast ORBD locations.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"> Replication viz-a-viz IOR Size</H2>
<P CLASS="western">For redundancy, every IOR must refer to at least
two ORBD instances.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If every server instance runs an ORBD for a large
cluster this may lead to large IORs and longer update times for all
of the ORBD replicas.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In a homogeneous environment, instead of having a
separate profile for each app server instance, we can have a single
profile containing TAG_ALTERNATE_IIOP_ADDRESS TAGGED_COMPONENTs with
host/port information for each app-server instance.  This reduces the
size of IORs.  However, their may be issues with online upgrades
having different information.  In that case a separate profile for
the upgraded app server.  Once all app servers were upgraded the
system could revert to a single profile again.  
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"> Interoperability with other app servers and
clients</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Interoperability is achieved by adherence to OMG
standards. If we generate IORs with multiple standard IIOP profiles
or single IIOP profiles containing TAG_ALTERNATE_IIOP_ADDRESS, we are
as compliant as we can be.  Exactly how an ORB handles such an IOR is
not specified by the the core CORBA standard.  (The CORBA
fault-tolerant specification defines a variant of IOR called an IOGR
that does specify the correct semantics.  However, we cannot depend
on that existing in other vendor's products.)</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">ORBD makes the system more interoperable with
other ORBs.  ORBD is build on the standard location forward mechanism
that all GIOP implementations must support.  We can do some load
balancing and failover for clients that are not running on our ORB,
by having our servers send LOCATION_FORWARDs back to ORBD whenever
they are overloaded.           
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Note: any client-side LB/FO we do via
CORBAContactInfoList is not standard.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Allow users to not use ORBD</H2>
<P CLASS="western">In the case were users are going with a colocated
deployment model it would be useful to not deploy ORBD.  ORBD only
needs to be present when for RMI-IIOP ACC clients or when segregated
web tier applications access EJBs on a separate cluster.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The colocated only model may benefit from a server
instance ORB using a &quot;local-only &quot;transport option that
initializes a local object that can never be marshaled and ensure
that the colocated request dispatcher optimization is always used.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">In this case customers should be using local EJBs,
but may not for various reasons (i.e., the ability to change
configuration without recoding).  
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"> Limitation: cannot add more ORBDs after cluster
created</H2>
<P CLASS="western">One significant issue in this design is that more
ORBD instances cannot easily be added after a cluster is created. The
existing ORBD instances may be moved to different nodes as desired,
but the number must stay fixed as otherwise persistent ORBD IORs will
not be preserved. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">We do not know of an easy solution to this
problem. One solution is to use IP multicast to communicate with ORBD
instances. All that is needed is an IP multicast call to locate ORBD
instances, which can then be handled in the normal multiple profile
IOR manner. It is possible to build such a proprietary IIOP extension
and incorporate this into the PEORB, although it is not a trivial
undertaking. Probably the larger issue is simply whether most
customers would accept the use of IP multicast in an app server, as
this is still not a commonly deployed protocol.</P>

<P CLASS="western">Smart Stubs are a Dumb Idea</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">1. Smart stubs used for load balancing and fault
tolerance place</P>
<P CLASS="western">   type-independent behavior in type-dependent
code.  This often</P>
<P CLASS="western">   increases the size of the stub code needlessly.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">2. Smart stubs are hard to manage if a system uses
multiple</P>
<P CLASS="western">   implementations of the same type.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">3. Smart stubs are a static solution.  The ORBD
approach allows the</P>
<P CLASS="western">   behavior of an invocation to change dynamically
from one invocation</P>
<P CLASS="western">   to the next.  For example, we could switch
protocols dynamically</P>
<P CLASS="western">   (if we decided to implement non-IIOP protocols
for some reason).</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">4. Smart stubs are harder to test, due to the
interaction of code</P>
<P CLASS="western">   generation rules for RMI-IIOP with the
requirements of a particular</P>
<P CLASS="western">   mechanism in the smart stub (i.e. M X N feature
interaction vs. M +</P>
<P CLASS="western">   N).  If we decide to do dynamic byte code
generation someday, it</P>
<P CLASS="western">   will also be easier to test with standard
stubs.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">5. Standard stubs are more easily replaced by
dynamic proxies.  This</P>
<P CLASS="western">   is an area that a lot of people on the ORB and
EJB sides would like</P>
<P CLASS="western">   to investigate further time permitting.  For
example, this could</P>
<P CLASS="western">   make deployment much faster, which could also
be a significant</P>
<P CLASS="western">   competitive advantage.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>

<P CLASS="western">6. Dynamic stub loading works better with standard

</P>
<P CLASS="western">Possible reasons that smart stubs are used in
other systems:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">1. They can solve some problems without deep ORB
knowledge.  Since we</P>
<P CLASS="western">   have the ORB expertise, we can do better.  We
also are building the</P>
<P CLASS="western">   PEORB so it can work very well in a highly
dynamic environment.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">2. It may be the best you can do in a non-CORBA
system (meaning non-OO</P>
<P CLASS="western">   RPC systems).  One of the critical features
that we use is the</P>
<P CLASS="western">   representation of an object reference
(basically the IOR).  This</P>
<P CLASS="western">   representation directly controls advanced
features like load</P>
<P CLASS="western">   balancing and fault tolerance, as well as
multiple protocol</P>
<P CLASS="western">   support.  We can also do compression of IORs by
establishing</P>
<P CLASS="western">   transport session state, and many other useful
optimizations.  But</P>
<P CLASS="western">   without this capability, a smart stub may be
the only options.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">3. Some type-dependent optimizations may be more
easily performed in a</P>
<P CLASS="western">   smart stub. For example, some beans may have
methods that fetch</P>
<P CLASS="western">   read-only, or just slowly chaning values.  Such
data can be cached</P>
<P CLASS="western">   in the stub, either with no update facility, or
with a simple cache</P>
<P CLASS="western">   invalidation protocol.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">   However, even this case can be handled pretty
well at the ORB</P>
<P CLASS="western">   level.  Basically this just requires building a
more advanced</P>
<P CLASS="western">   ClientSubcontract that can cache appropriately
based on the</P>
<P CLASS="western">   operation name.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">   All of these sort of ideas were expressed a
decade ago in the</P>
<P CLASS="western">   Spring project at Sun labs.</P>

<P CLASS="western">How do we construct a forwarded IOR using multiple
templates. While the current ORT standard does not directly address
this point, Ken designed the standard to allow extensibility in this
area. The important point is that the ORT standard defines two types:
the <SPAN LANG="en-US">ObjectReferenceFactory</SPAN> and the
ObjectReferenceTemplate, which extends ObjectReferenceFactory. The
ObjectReferenceFactory defines a make_object method, which creates an
IOR, and the ObjectReferenceTemplate adds methods to obtain the
server ID, ORB ID, and ObjectAdapter ID. This information<SPAN LANG="en-US">
uniquely </SPAN>identifies the template within the domain of a single
ORBD, and is essential for the matching of templates that ORBD
performs. This separation allows multiple templates to be merged into
a single factory, losing their unique identity, but still supporting
the crucial make_object operation.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The question still remains: how do we merge the
templates?  Here we will rely on a proprietary extension to ORT, and
allow access to the underlying <SPAN LANG="en-US">IORTemplate</SPAN>
inside the ORT. The IORTemplate explicitly allows access to its
constituent profile templates, so we can extract the profile
templates from all of the ORTs, combine them into a single

combined IORTemplate.</P>

<P CLASS="western">Retry behavior is crucial for ORBD in two ways. 
First, ORBD functions mainly as a redirector using LOCATION_FORWARD.
Since we do not want to funnel every request in the system through
ORBD, the client caches the effective IOR in order to improve
efficiency. Secondly, if part of the cluster fails or becomes
overloaded, we need a way to tell a client that it should try
something else to satisfy its invocation. This can be accomplished by
trying another profile or falling back to the ORBD to try again at
that level:</P>
