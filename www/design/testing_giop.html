         <P> </P> <HR WIDTH="75%"> 
         <P> Last Modified: <I>May 17, 2004</I> </P> 
         <P> Version: 1.6 </P> 
         <ADDRESS> <A HREF="mailto:ken.cavanaugh@sun.com">&lt;Ken Cavanaugh&gt;</A>
                </ADDRESS> 
         <P> We often need to examine problems in CORBA that are related to the
                details of marshalling messages for CDR encoded GIOP messages. This is
                currently a difficult and time-consuming problem due to the lack of tools for
                this task. Harsha Godugu is working on a GIOP analyzer to make this process
                easier. This note discusses some ORB changes needed to support the GIOP
                analyzer, and also to make other debugging tasks easier. </P>
         <P> What we need is the following: </P>
         <UL>
                <LI>An API for capturing the messages sent and received by a particular
                  invocation. This will allow us to gather data for testing the GIOP analyzer .
                  </LI>
                <LI>An API for taking a sequence of messages and converting that sequence
                  into an input stream. Utilities for converting an array of strings or a text
                  file in the GIOP dump format will also be useful. </LI>
         </UL>
         <H2>Getting an Input Stream from Messages</H2>
         <P>Probably the simplest possible representation for the data contained in
                a sequence of messages is simply byte[][]. Wherever I use this type to
                represent a sequence of messages, we will assume that: </P>
         <OL>
                <LI>The first message in the sequence is either a (GIOP) request or
                  reply. </LI>
                <LI>Subsequent messages are all fragment messages. </LI>
                <LI>Every message except the last has the more fragment bit set. </LI>
                <LI>All messages in the sequence share the same request ID. </LI>
         </OL>
         <P>If any of these conditions fail, getMessageData should throw an
                appropriate exception. getMessageData is a new method on the ORB SPI defined as
                follows: </P>
         <PRE>
    /** Messages must be an array of GIOP messages.  The first message must
     * be a GIOP request or response.  Any subsequent messages must be
     * fragment messages with the same request ID as the first message.
     * This returns a MessageData interface, in which all of the Messages
     * have been unmarshalled, and the result of getStream is a stream
     * that is prepared to unmarshal the request or reply body.
     */
    MessageData getMessageData( byte[][] messages ) ;
</PRE>
         <P> MessageData is an interface defined as follows: </P>
         <PRE>
public interface MessageData {
    /** An array GIOP Messages.  The first message is a request or reply,
     * all subsequent messages are fragments with the same request ID.
     */
    Message[] getMessages() ;

    /** A fully initialized input stream for the message data, positioned
     * at the first element of the body.
     */
    CDRInputStream getStream() ;
}
</PRE>
         <P> To support this, we need a Connection that is backed by a byte[][] or
                equivalent. I am currently testing this, which us called
                BufferedConnectionImpl. </P>
         <H2>Capturing Messages from an Invocation</H2>
         <P>The idea here is to provide an interface that allows the programmer to
                obtain the sequence of messages in the request and reply from a CORBA method
                invocation. The model I have designed for this is fairly simple and easy to
                use. First, we define a new interface called a MessageTraceManager: </P>
         <PRE>
public interface MessageTraceManager {
    /** Returns true if messages are to be captured on this thread, otherwise
     * false.
     */
    boolean isEnabled() ;

    /** Called with flag=true to enable capture of messages
     */
    void enable( boolean flag ) ;

    /** Return an array of messages (represented as byte[]) for the 
     * message(s) sent for the request in the last invocation.  In the
     * event of a location forward, this is the sequence for the last
     * invocation.
     */
    byte[][] getRequestData() ;

    /** Return an array of messages (represented as byte[]) for the 
     * message(s) received for the last invocation.  In the event of
     * a location forward, this is the sequence received from the last
     * invocation.
     */
    byte[][] getResponseData() ;
}
</PRE>
         <P> This interface allows access to the messages sent and received in the
                last request. To obtain an instance of MessageTraceManager, we add the
                following API to the ORB SPI: </P>
         <PRE>
    /** Return a MessageTraceManager for the current thread.  Each thread that
     * calls this method gets its own MessageTraceManager.
     */
    MessageTraceManager getMessageTraceManager() 
</PRE>
         <P> This API allows message data to be collected from any synchronous CORBA
                invocation. This include RMI-IIOP, IDL, and DII (but not deferred synchronous
                invocations). A test could also simulate a stub invocation if desired. </P> 
         <H2>ORB Code Notes</H2>
         <P> Start with receipt of read event on a connection: </P>
         <OL>
                <LI> SocketOrChannelAcceptorImpl.createMessageMediator( Broker,
                  Connection ) 
                  <OL>
                         <LI>CorbaContactInfoBase.createMessageMediator( Broker, Connection )

                         <LI>msg.setByteBuffer( null ) ; </LI>
                         <LI>messageMediator = new CorbaMessageMediatorImpl( orb, connection,
                                msg, byteBuffer ) </LI>
                  </OL></LI>
                <LI>After creating the message mediator, we end up going through the
                  double dispatch and end up in CorbaMessageMediatorImpl.handleInput(
                  RequestMessage_1_2 ). This calls: 
                  <OL>
                         <LI>header.unmarshalRequestID </LI>
                         <LI>setInputObject (line 872), which calls
                                CorbaContactInfoBase.setInputObject(), which creates the CDRInputObject. </LI>
                         <LI>handleRequest(RequestMessage_1_2, CorbaMessageMediator </LI>
                         <LI>beginRequest(messageMediator) </LI>
                         <LI>handleRequestRequest(messageMediator) 
                                <OL>
                                  <LI>This calls unmarshalHeader, then finally does the dispatch.
                                         </LI>
                                </OL></LI>
                  </OL></LI>
         </OL>
         <P>Note that we generally always need to call unmarshalRequestID before we
                can do much else, since the transport does not know where to put anything
                without knowing the request ID (it's obvious from the code that one of GIOP's
                minor blunders is not putting the request ID in the GIOP message header, since
                it is so frequently needed). Here is a sketch of the code for getMessageData(
                byte[][] data ): </P>
         <PRE>
public MessageData getMessageData( byte[][] data )
{
    connection = new BufferedConnectionImpl() ;
    for (int ctr=0; ctr&lt;data.length; ctr++)
        // write data[ctr] to connection

    final Message[] messages = new Message[data.length] ;
    int requestID = 0 ;
    Message firstMessage = null ;
    Message msg = null ;
    CDRInputObject inobj = null ;
    BufferManagerRead buffman = null ;

    for (int ctr=0; ctr&lt;data.length; ctr++) {
        msg = MessageBase.readGIOPMessage( orb, connectionCopy ) ;
        messages[ctr] = msg ;
        msg.unmarshalRequestID() ; // Do we always do this?
        // Check that moreFragments == (ctr &lt; data.length)

        if (ctr==0) {
            // Check that we have a request or reply
            requestID = msg.getRequestID() ;
            firstMessage = msg ;
            requestID = msg.getRequestID() ;
            inobj = new CDRInputObject( orb, connection,
                msg.getByteBuffer(), msg ) ;
            buffman = inobj.getBufferManager() ;
        } else {
            // Check that the request ID is as expected
            buffman.processFragment( msg, msg.getByteBuffer() ) ;
        }
    }

    // Unmarshal all the data in the first message.  This may 
    // cause other fragments to be read.
    firstMessage.unmarshalHeader( stream ) ;

    final CDRInputObject resultObj = inobj ;

    return new MessageData() {
       Message[] getMessages() { return messages ; }
       CDRInputStream getInputStream() { return resultObj ; }
    } ;
}
